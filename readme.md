# nimtga

A simple library to read and write the [TGA image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA) written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).

Some limited image editing operations (rotate, concatenate, scale) are also included although those are not specific to TGA, they just operate on a sequence of pixels.
